dew point is the temperature at which dew forms. For a telescope mirror or other telescope equipment, if the temperature of the instrument falls below the dew point, dew will form on the instrument and degrade its performance.

Tdp = T - (100 - RH)/5 for RH>50%

This can be expressed as a simple rule of thumb:
For every 1Â°C difference in the dew point and dry bulb temperatures, the relative humidity decreases by 5%, starting with RH = 100% when the dew point equals the dry bulb temperature.
